# AI Smart Study Planner with Stress Prediction

## Overview

This project is a practical application of Machine Learning aimed at helping students manage their study routine more effectively. It analyzes basic daily habits such as study hours, sleep duration, screen time, and subject difficulty to estimate the student’s stress level.

The main idea behind this project comes from a common issue faced by students, especially during exams — unstructured study patterns and rising stress. This system not only predicts stress but also provides simple suggestions to improve daily habits.

## How It Works

The project follows a simple workflow:

1. A dataset is created containing features like study hours, sleep hours, screen time, and difficulty level.
2. The stress level is used as the target variable.
3. A Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression) is trained on this data.
4. The trained model is saved and used in the main application.
5. The user enters their daily routine in the app, and the system predicts the stress level.
6. Based on the prediction, the app suggests ways to improve study habits.
